OPTIONAL MODULE (LANE 2 ONLY): NCSEAA K12 PROGRAMS
- New School Registration checklist
- Signed Nonpublic School Agreement
- Tuition & Fee Schedule submission (required vs optional separated)
- Billing controls: allowable vs non-allowable

------------------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL RULES (to avoid contradictions)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Never market Lane 1 (Homeschool Support) as “scholarship-funded tuition.”
2) Only Lane 2 (Private School Enrollment) can say “scholarships accepted” (if approved/participating).
3) Keep two separate:
   - invoices/billing categories
   - student record systems
   - program handbooks (Lane 1 vs Lane 2)
4) Publish policies publicly, but keep student records and sensitive compliance docs private.
