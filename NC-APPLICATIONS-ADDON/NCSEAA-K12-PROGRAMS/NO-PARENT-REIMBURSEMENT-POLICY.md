# No Parent Reimbursement Policy (NCSEAA K12 Programs) — Draft

School: [TBD]

## Policy
When scholarship funds are disbursed directly to the school (direct payment), the school does not reimburse parents/guardians for tuition and required fees using scholarship funds, except where explicitly permitted by NCSEAA guidance.

## Implementation
- Parent accounts show charges, payments, and any credits.
- Any refunds follow the school withdrawal/refund policy and NCSEAA rules.
- Staff training: billing team reviews “allowable vs not allowable” cost rules annually.

Billing/Finance Lead: [TBD]
