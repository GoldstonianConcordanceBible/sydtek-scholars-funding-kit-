## Official Operating Model (NC): HYBRID (Flowchart C)
SydTek Scholars operates in **two lanes**:

- **Lane 1: Homeschool Support (DNPE Homeschool families)**  
  We provide curriculum guidance, coaching, tutoring, parent training, and accountability supports. **Families remain the homeschool** (they file NOI and keep homeschool compliance records).

- **Lane 2: Private School Enrollment (DNPE Private School)**  
  Students enroll in our private school program with **tuition + required academic fees** and we maintain official school records (attendance, grades, transcripts/report cards as applicable).

- **Optional: NCSEAA K12 Programs (Scholarships)**  
  Scholarship participation applies to **Lane 2 only** (Private School Enrollment) and must be based on actual approval/participation. **Lane 1 is never marketed as scholarship-funded tuition.**

## What this repo is
This GitHub repo is the **single source of truth** for:
- Policies, templates, and operating procedures
- Evidence maps and accreditation readiness artifacts
- Scholarship-readiness (Lane 2 optional) documentation
- Governance, safeguarding, financial controls
- Impact model and reporting cadence

This repo is designed so a team can run the school **with clarity**, and so the public can verify governance and integrity **without exposing private student data**.
