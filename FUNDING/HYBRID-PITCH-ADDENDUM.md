# Hybrid Model Addendum (for funders)

We run a two-lane model to maximize access while keeping compliance clear:

## Lane 1: Homeschool Support (Access lane)
- Lower-cost services for families already homeschooling
- Families keep their own homeschool compliance records
- We provide templates, coaching, and accountability supports

## Lane 2: Private School Enrollment (Scholarship/records lane)
- Full enrollment with official student records
- Tuition + required academic fees structure
- Optional acceptance of scholarship payments if approved/participating

## Why funders like this
- Access + affordability without compliance confusion
- Cleaner audits: Lane 2 has school-grade controls
- Scalable: Lane 1 expands reach; Lane 2 anchors legitimacy and outcomes
