SydTek Scholars operates in two lanes.

## Lane 1: Homeschool Support
- Services: coaching, tutoring, curriculum support, parent training
- Records: service delivery notes only (no official school transcripts)
- Billing: service fees paid by families; not scholarship-funded tuition
- Messaging: "support services" only

## Lane 2: Private School Enrollment
- Services: official enrollment + instruction
- Records: attendance, grades/report cards, transcripts (as applicable)
- Billing: tuition + required academic fees; optional scholarships if approved/participating
- Messaging: "enrollment" + "tuition" + "official records"

## Required controls
- Separate handbooks, billing codes, and record systems by lane
- No cross-posting scholarship language into Lane 1 pages
